<h1>The Best Movies According To Sid</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2><br>
<hr />
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>One of the most jaw-opening cinematics paired with real-to-fiction science stuff and emotions by Nolan</p>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>Probably has the top place on my list due to the brilliant use of Nolan's writing skills and the way he accompanies science in his movies</p>
<h3>The whole Pirates Of The Caribbean Trlogy</h3>
<p>Know this doesn't count as a single movie but johnny depp is too good</p>
